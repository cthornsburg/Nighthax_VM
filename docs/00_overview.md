# Overview

This repo provides a **CTF VM setup kit** for NLC NighHax / cyber defense students.

## What this is
- Guidance for creating a base Linux VM (Windows 11 host; VirtualBox or VMware)
- A bootstrap workflow: `git clone` inside the VM → run scripts to install/prepare tools
- Curated browser bookmarks + recommended extensions
- Troubleshooting notes (including last-resort Windows 11 security setting changes)

## What this is NOT
- Not a prebuilt VM appliance (no OVA/VDI distribution)
- Not a replacement for CTF writeups (those live in the `nlc_cyber` repo)

## Supported baseline
- Guest OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS family (recommended: **Xubuntu 24.04 LTS**)
- Hypervisors: VirtualBox (primary docs) and VMware Workstation (supported)

## CTF writeups
CTF writeups and broader program resources live here:
